# Studio Platform
_OPEN SOURSE_

The idea was brought up by my friend, who is a studio owner. He wants to post daily feed of his studio. And a place to manage his studio. So I decide to build this platform. 

## Hi, I am Harry :blush:
This is a project I started while I was learning React. I do not have much time to finish this soon, since I have a full time job now.

So, I invite you to contribute this together.

Since it is now an open source project, it will be open to be used by all people who wants to use it.

## Installation

## Current situation
Now, all docs are missing, and code is messy. I will update it weekly to do clean-ups. Please contact me if you get confused.

## Tech stack
Backend : ```Nodejs + express``` 

DB: ```psql```

Frontend: ```Reactjs```
